This is a sample app that I wrote as a part of a take home challenge for Bolt. It fetches JSON lists of simple items from a set of endpoints, formats/transforms them into one of four domain object using a Mapper class, and displays them in their respective ComposeFragments.
This project makes use of Compose for UI, Ktor for building API calls, and Koin for Dependency Injection.
This project implements the MVVM and respository architectural patterns, with API declarations (ItemKtorImpl) and their calls (ItemRepository)in seperate classes, which would support modularization and easy extendability in a more complex app. Data is fetched in the ItemViewModel via the ItemInteractor that provides access to the aforementioned data sources.
