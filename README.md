This is a sample app that I wrote as a part of a take home challenge for Bolt. It fetches JSON lists of simple items from a set of endpoints, formats/transforms them into one of four domain object using mapper classes, and displays them in their respective Screens
This project makes use of Jetpack Compose for UI, Ktor for building API calls, and Koin for Dependency Injection.
This project implements the MVVM and repository architectural patterns, with API declarations (DndKtorImpl) and their calls (DndRepository) in separate classes, which would support modularization and easy extendability if this app were to become larger. Data is fetched from ViewModels via Interactors that provides access to the aforementioned data sources from the view layer.
